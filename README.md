## Algorithmic Approach

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0df53a3c-0582-40c4-9813-c008399dbff4)

### **1. Real-Time Heatmap Generation**

A **grid-based spatial mapping algorithm** tracks peopleâ€™s movement, creating live heatmaps.  

#### **Algorithm:**  

1. Capture real-time video feed and detect people.
2. Map detected personâ€™s centroid `(cx, cy)` onto a grid.
3. Update heatmap based on position frequency.

```python
row = cy / cell_height
col = cx / cell_width
```
<div align="center"> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23804a97-fd6d-43d5-9c1a-de3f14efd4c6" width="600px"> </div>

### **2. Exponential Moving Average for Queue Smoothing**

To prevent erratic queue size fluctuations, an **Exponential Moving Average (EMA) algorithm** smooths the data:

#### **Algorithm:**  

1. Measure real-time queue size.
2. Apply EMA smoothing to reduce sudden fluctuations.
3. Use a smoothing factor Î± (0 < Î± â‰¤ 1) to adjust responsiveness.
 
```python
EMA_Size = Î± * Queue_size + (1 - Î±) * EMASize
```
<div align="center"> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40381e65-14d9-41e0-97fa-597a54b20c1e" width="600px"> </div>

### **3. Wait time estimation algorithm**

Wait time is estimated dynamically.

#### **Algorithm:**  

1. Measure queue length in real-time.
2. Multiply queue length by the base service time per customer.
3. Provide an estimated waiting time for customers.

```python
Wait_Time = Queue_length * Base Time
```

<div align="center"> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52d84409-a7db-481c-9f7e-98ee2e70902b" width="600px"> </div>

### **4. Dynamic Staff Allocation Algorithm**

The system optimizes staff allocation based on real-time queue size.

#### **Algorithm:**  

1. Compute required staff using EMA queue size.
2. Assign cashiers, cooks, and servers dynamically.
3. Ensure minimum and maximum staff limits.

```python
required_staff = max(1, EMA_Size / 3)
cashiers = min(5, required_staff / 3 + 1)
cooks = min(6, required_staff / 2)
servers = required_staff - cashiers - cooks
```

<div align="center"> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/daa166b3-02a9-49c9-a1e6-32a2ec896a5c" width="600px"> </div>

### **5. Dynamic Pricing** 

The system dynamically adjusts pricing and marketing based on demand.

#### **Algorithm:**  
1. Retrieve **current food demand** from sales data.  
2. For each food item:  
   - Check if demand is **high** (â‰¥ HIGH_DEMAND_THRESHOLD).  
     - **Increase price** by 20%.  
   - Check if demand is **low** (â‰¤ LOW_DEMAND_THRESHOLD).  
     - **Decrease price** by 20%.  
   - Otherwise, **keep the base price**.  
3. Update prices dynamically and apply changes to the system.  

```python
  if count >= HIGH_DEMAND_THRESHOLD:
      price = round(base_price * 1.2, 2)  # Increase by 20%
  elif count <= LOW_DEMAND_THRESHOLD:
      price = round(base_price * 0.8, 2)  # Decrease by 20%
  else:
      price = base_price  # Keep base price
```

### **6. Targeted Marketing**

Marketing messages are generated based on real-time food stall demand.

#### **Algorithm:**  
1. Check food demand levels.
2. Display different marketing messages based on sales.

```python
if count >= HIGH_DEMAND_THRESHOLD:
    message = f"{food.capitalize()} is selling fast! Get yours before it's gone!"
elif count == MEDIUM_DEMAND_THRESHOLD:
    message = f"{food.capitalize()} is a customer favorite! Order now!"
elif count <= LOW_DEMAND_THRESHOLD:
    message = f"Special deal on {food.capitalize()}! Limited time offer."
```
